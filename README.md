# Form_for Lab

## Objectives

1. Use form_for to build a new form
2. Use form_for to build an edit form
3. Mass assign form data to AR instances on new and edit
4. Build RESTFul actions for new, create, edit, and update, with the correct routes and route helper urls.

## Notes

use form_for to build a new_form.html.erb and an edit_form.html.erb for Post and Author, 4 forms in total.
We've given a Post model with title and content and an author model with name.
There are two controllers for posts and authors with index and show, you need to build new, create, edit, and update.
you'll need to create the correct routes with the correct names for form_for to get the route urls correctly.
make sure to use form_for.
